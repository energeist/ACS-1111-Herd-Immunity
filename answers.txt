1 - What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate, initial infected)

python3 simulation.py 100000 0.90 Ebola 0.70 0.25 10

- initial population: 100000
- initial vaccination %: 90%
- virus name: Ebola
- virus mortality rate: 70%
- virus reproductive rate: 25%
- initial infected people: 10

- snapshot_log_snapshot.md output included in repo for answers 2-4

2 - What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

- Percentage of total population infected: 9.00% (or 90% of original unvaccinated population)

3 - What percentage of the population died from the virus?

- Percentage of total population that died: 6.38%

9% population infected * 70% mortality rate ~= 6.3% which is within margin of error for a random simulation.

4 - Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

- Total number of times a vaccine prevented infection: 865645
