1 - What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

python3 simulation.py 100000 0.90 Ebola 0.70 0.25 10

2 - What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

3 - What percentage of the population died from the virus?

4 - Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
