## END OF SIMULATION SUMMARY:
- Reason for simulation ending: Test log ended
- Initial population: 1000
- Total deaths: too many

- Remaining living population: a pittance
- Initial vaccinated population: not enough
- Final vaccinated population: far too few
- Total number of unique infections: I can't bear to look
- Percentage of total population infected: 100.00%
